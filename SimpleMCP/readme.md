Simple MCP type of code without any downloading. Creating a python code for the interaction.
•	This code only written code in python and both MCP server and MCP client code is written in python. Its basic and it is not interacting with any server or tools.
•	We use run_interactive.py to execute the MCP project. Based on the input given by the user, It goes to the function host.send_message() in mcp_host.py and it process_context based on the data we give. 
•	In simple words,it extracts the “read” and “search” word from the text. And return the print statement. Else give us “I’m ready what you would like me to do” message.
This code makes us understand what are the actors involved in the MCP code like Agent and the Host (server). This is not main working of MCP but general understanding of code.
